ADDED A GRAPHIC LOGO
The user can personalize it changing the image in styles/logo.png
Reviewed the style to accomplish with the logo

New settings' flag "_expandFolderTree" to start with the navigation tree
hidden, expanded or expanded at the first level

The tree status (hide/show) will be preserved through folder actions

The witdh of open/closed tree can be defined using CSS (in "clean" CSS style 
"tree-open" and "tree-closed" )

DIFFERENT COMMENTS FOR DOCUMENT AND VERSION
Creating a document user can insert a different comment for version and for 
entire document. If the version comment is leaved empty the document comment 
will be used for both

Added a warning about the maximum upload file size in the upload pages 
(add document and add files). The size is a server setting and does not depend 
by letoDMS

Better allignment in the view document page (Thanks to alekseyn). Better 
allignment in the view document version page.
Note: the allignement is simply suggested setting width in table columns, thus
can be modified by very long strings.

Now checking none between keywords,name and comment in search form means 
searching all. That's a more logical way (same as behaviour of status checks)

Added a settings var for default calendar view (week,month or year)

Simplified the "Related documents" table: now the public yes/no is visible
only to the user tha can edit it

Removed a small bug with calendar function inclusion (thanks to c8900219)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADDED MULTIPLE DOCUMENT INCLUSION
in "Add document" page there's a new switch to add multiple files
for every file a new document will be created in the folder
the size limit depends on server settings
if multiple file are added:
- the file name is used to name the document
- expiration, reviewers, approvers, comment, etc will be the same for every 
  document

ADDED HUMAN-READABLE OPTION ON ARCHIVE CREATION:
with a flag in the "archive creation" tool the archive can be created using
DMS paths and original file names. The archive contains only the last version
of every file. Clearly a human readable archive cannot be used to restore a 
server backup but they are handyer for external uses.

ADDED A SIDEBAR WITH TREE VIEW on the folder browsing
the feature is optional an there's a new settings flag
	var $_enableFolderTree = true;
The sidebar shows only folders (a complete tree wich includes document would be 
very heavy on most installation)

ADDED A SHARED CALENDAR for DMS users
- there'a new menu item ("calendar") to access the calendar
- the starting view is current week
- calendar has 3 view : year, month and week
- every event has start/end time (only date), user, creation and date, name and comment
- no hour/minute management (is not intent as personal/daily calendar)
- events can be added and viewed by everyone (are public)
- the event can be edit and delete by the user who insert it or by administrators
- the feature is optional (can be deactivated in inc.Settings)

ADDED A SIMPLE DB DUMP UTILITY in the Admin-Tools/Backup tools
- the feature should complete the backup utilities toolkit
- THE DB DUMP IS EXPERIMENTAL AND MUST BE TESTED WITH YOUR DB
- The created will require an empty existing db to restore data (content only)

IMPROVED THE DOCUMENT SEARCH FOR DOCUMENT STATUS
now one can search all document rejected, expired, obsolete, ecc.
reordered and restyled search form and result list

Beautyfied e-mail messages

The document expiration date (if any) is now showed near the status

lined up the reviewer approvers table in view document and document details

Fixed a bug with the time picker

improved the folder chooser dialog

Reordered the theme folders

Fixed a not define accessmode in document chooser

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a first major release with a lot of changes, then some new features 
can contain new bugs. The DB require a small change: update.sql is included 
in the folder UPDATE-v1.9

ADDED THE MANDATORY REVIEWERS AND APPROVERS LIST (per user):
Administrator can associate to every user one or more users as mandatory 
reviewer/approver. Every document inserted by that user will be forced 
to be reviewed/approved by the users in that list. Note that if document is
not readable by the mandatory approver/reviewer then the appoval/review
will not be required (for example will not be required for private documents).

ADDED A LOGGING SYSTEM:
- works with plain files
- administrator tools includes a page to view/download/delete log files
- log files are rotated with a time parameter in settings ($_logFileRotation)
The logging system is an experimental feature and must be carefully tested in 
large multiuser environments. There are two new parameters in inc.Settings to enable. 

USERS CAN NOW BE HIDDEN FROM USERS LISTS viewed by all (there's a "hide" checkbox in user manager page) 
this function works with the "user view" list shown to all users
clearly if "$_enableUsersView = false" in configuration the option is useless

- the new personal administration is included in "myAccount" menu of every user
- ADDED RECURSIVE INCLUSION (folder with all subfolders and/or all documents)

Viewonline now works (but should be tested again with different platforms)

Owner of a document is now emailed if someone else rename/move/update the document

When a document is reviewed/approved the mail is now correclty sent to the 
document updater (the user who update the version) not necessarly to the owner.

ADDED SWITCH BETWEEN ALPHABETICAL OR ORIGINAL ORDER in the folder view 
clicking on the "name" column header

The archive includes an older version of adodb working with MySQL-4

The downloadable text file with versioning infos is now updated immediatly before download

Bugfixed the create_table.sql

Removed a bug in english language file

Removed last references to the old name "myDMS"

Restyled and improved the "backup tools" page

Bugfixed the datechooser (was limited to 2010)

ADDED THE EDITABLE "MANAGER" FLAG TO GROUP MEMBER
now one (or more) user can be flagged as "manager" group member
Currently group notification are editable only by group managers
but the flag will be required for future use

IMPROVED THE GROUP/USER MANAGEMENT PAGES

- now the page refresh immediatly when new data are saved

Restyled and improve the "edit access permission" pages

Improved the keyword category editing

- the "add new" operation uses the hide/show javascript
- now the page refresh immediatly when new data are saved
- the keyword category operation has been removed from administration 
  personal account menu (the operation has gone in administration tool's menu
  because administrator edits the global keywords categories)
  
Improved Keword chooser

Added quick installation instruction on the README file

THE USER IMAGES ARE NOW OPTIONAL (the implementation is poor and doesn't work
on every system, then can be disabled)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

start a document with a version > 1)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.8.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

REDESIGNED THE ORGANIZATION OF DATA FOLDER 

Now the data folder (where files are located) has a more efficient organization:
data_dir / id / version.filetype

This scheme makes backups much more intuitive (the folder name corresponds 
to the id of the document, all versions and attached files
are in the same folder.

- Removed no longer needed tdbDirPath and tdlPathList
- Removed no longer needed free path lookup functions
- Modified sql create_tables.sql for changes to the DB in accordance with the new organization

WARNING: This change makes the version incompatible with existing archives/DB
but is required by the all thennew features (read ahead)

The "UPDATE" folder contais two script for updating existing installations

To update an existing archive:
- Backup all (including DB)
- Install the new DMS version
- Install the "UPDATE" folder containing two files update.php and update.sql
- Log in as administrator
- Manually invoke the script (http://indirizzo/UPDATE/update.php
- Remove the folder "UPDATE"

If everything works well the old content has ben renamed "old" and can be removed (eg via ftp)

ADDITIONAL FILES 

Added the ability to upload additional files associated to a document (as attachments)
these files are not versioned and are designed as accessories to the document
(Eg the PDF version or reductions in the image). The files are associated with
the document, not to version.

NOTE: To add attachments the user must have write permission on the document
The attachment can be removed by the user who added it or having total permissions

BACKUP

Added some useful tools for backing up files and folders (real files, not the DB).
Especially useful for working with entire folders which, being virtual,
can not easily be backupped via ftp.

There are three operations designed to be eventually applied in sequence.

Data Backup versioning:
Create for each document in a DMS folder a file containing the main versioning informations
This allows you to make backup copies of which also contain information from the DB.
This is meant to be performed before the creation of an archive,
After creating the file versioning file can be viewed from out.ViewDocument

Creating Archives:
Creates a tar.gz file containing all files related to a specific
DMS folder. The file is created in settings->_contentDir
The file is constructed so that it can be unpacked again in the settings->_contentDir
to restore removed files. In the page is presented the list of existing backup files
which you can downloaded or delete

Deleting files:
you can delete from the server all the files related to a specific
DMS folder and all its subfolders. By doing this you can
free space on the server without removing the version information
saved in the database that will be available for regular consultation.
Having a backup deleted files can easily be restored when needed.

All backups operations can be performed on the entire archive or only on a DMS folder.
All backups operations are accessible only to administrators.

OTHER FEATURES

Added the possibility to change a approval/review already done.
The editing is possible at any moment only to the user who made it.
The time is retained (so you can understand subsequent amendments).
The document status is updated automatically following a change.
The editing is only possible on the latest version of the document.
If a document expire date is set editing is only possible within that time

Added delete_all_contents script. Cleaning DB tool for test use

Proper content of some e-mail

Added general information to the statistic page:
- No. of documents
- No. of folders
- No. of files in every document
- Number of total files
- Total size of the archive

Fixed the view of system notify list

The comments related to the update opration (versione comment) are now editable

Adjusted out.DefaultKeywords now equal to out.UserDefaultKeyword

Added function formatted_size (view size in Bytes / Kb / Mb / Gb) in inc.Utils and applied where necessary

Fixed a bug on documents cancellation (was not removed the corresponding list of notification)

The files in data folder can be removed without cause errors in the DMS.
When a file is not effectively present in out.ViewDocument displays a warning "file removed"
and, of course, is no longer given the option to download.
This feature can be used to free up space on the server, removing old files, while leaving available the corresponding
version information.

Fixed the view in out.AddSubFolder.php (default font size)

Added icons for openoffice.org mime-type
Added icons for some types of extensions (bz, dot, docx, etc.).

Added (in inc.settings) option to disable the user administrator as a reviewer / approver (not listed)

Remove the untranslated instructions "die" (replaced by UI:: exitError)

Proper control permissions for internal links (related document):
- The guest user can not add links
- Users without write permission can only add links private
- Add link publici the user must have write permission
- To cancel link should be the user that added or have permission to total

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.8
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The reviewer/approver can edit his review/approval after having submitted it. 
Only the user whom effectivly submitted the review/approval can edit it, 
even if he was required as group member. The document status will be updated 
autmatically according with the modified submission. The edit is possible only 
on the last version of a document (there's no reason to edit a old version).
If expiration date is set the edit is possible (obviously) only within that date.

Account menu has been reviewed.

Two new pages containing general views of groups and users are integrated in 
the account menu. The feature can be disabled in inc.Settings.php.

The email notification can be completely disabled in inc.Settings.php. Every 
users can leave empty his e-mail field to not receive e-mail even if 
strictFormCheck is on.

Fix of two redirection bugs after deleting documents or folders.

The notification list is now integrated in the myDocument page/menu.

The general tree view has been enhance.

Fix of some e-mail composition errors.

Fix of some italian translation errors.

The owner is no longer automatically added to the notification list of 
a document. The notification lists should not be modified automatically 
(if not required the notification are annoying)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.7.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Style Sheet modifications to improve IE6 compatibility, contributed by
	Juan Lago (thanks Juan!). This fixes some placement issues with elements
	that have the position attribute set to "absolute".

- The div elements that are used to clear floats have been fixed so that they
	have zero height in IE6. It is not enough to specify "height: 0"; one must
	also set "font-size:0" otherwise IE6 will set the height of the element to
	match the standard font size.

- UI layout improvements. Various changes to the user interface to improve
	the page flow and allow for further expansion in the future. The context
	menu bar has been separated from the page heading into its own container
	underneath the title. It's a more logical place to present the menu, and
	will allow for the easy addition of further sub-headings in the future
	without compromising the page flow.

- The last dependency on the original theme system has been eliminated with
	the introduction of updated chooser dialogues for selecting files and
	folders. These dialogues have the new themes and the code has been revamped,
	replacing the old table structures with unordered lists.

- LDAP update. A minor change to the LDAP authentication code to allow for
	the use of URIs to identify the server name (e.g. ldaps://host.com).
	Also, the LDAP version is set to 3 in order to support secure connections.

- New language translations for Czech and Slovak. Contributed by SF user
	helix84 (thanks!).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.7.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Re-vamped Notification system allows users to receive an email when a
  document or folder is changed. This is a new, event-based mechanism that
  notifies the user as soon as the change has been made and replaces the
  cron mechanism originally developed. Any user that has read access to a
  document or folder can subscribe to be notified of changes. Users that
  have been assigned as reviewers or approvers for a document are
  automatically added to the notification system for that document.

  A new page has been created for users to assist with the management of
  their notification subscriptions. This can be found in the "My Account"
  section under "Notification List".

- The test used to identify HTTPS connections has been improved so that it
  correctly identifies IIS servers that have ISAPI enabled but are not
  using HTTPS protocol.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.7.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixes to CSS display bugs. Minor updates to the display.

- Improved handling of character escape sequences.

- Review / Approve dates added to folder views and search results.

- New file system directory management code to accommodate limitations in the
  underlying filesystem which restrict the number of files that MyDMS can
  store. MyDMS now uses a nested directory structure to store files, rather
  than a flat one. However, note that individual files are still stored one
  per directory in order to preserve compatibility with older versions of
  MyDMS.

  For details of the problem and the solution implemented, please refer to:

    http://mydms.sf.net/2007/08/15/new-file-system-storage-structure/

- Hungarian translation.

- And as a bonus, there is a Drupal theme compatible with MyDMS.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.6.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Theme and language choice are now saved as user attributes between
	sessions. Read update-1.6.1.txt for changes to database schema.

- Link to document review / approval page from out.ViewDocument.php.

- French translation.

- Brazilian Portuguese translation.

- Traditional Chinese translation.

- Relaxation of criteria for selecting reviewers / approvers. Users now only
	require read access to be eligible reviewers or approvers.

- Documents are now displayed in the correct sequence in the folder view.

- Documents can be downloaded directly from the folder view by clicking their
	icon.

- Document icons in the folder view now reflect the document type.

- Empty passwords are not accepted, even when JS is disabled in the browser.

- New restricted access mode rejects login from users who are not entered
	into the internal database, even if LDAP authentication was successful.

	the admin user. Previously, both actions were possible.

- Users can be assigned administrative privileges in the User Manager.

- Deleting document revisions or the document itself notifies all affected
	users by email, deletes entries from all status logs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.5.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------		     

- Fixed a bug in the keyword editing code which was preventing users from
  adding default keywords into global keyword categories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.5.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------		     

- Optimised search. Improved the performance of the search function by
  placing more of the work on the database and by applying indexes to some of
  the tables. Sub-folder searches are also dramatically improved due to the
  incorporation of a folderList field in the tblDocuments table.

- Optimised display. New compact theme significantly reduces the page load
  times. This is the default theme. The original is still available as a
  selection.

- Changed file download headers such that downloading works with IE over SSL.

- Changed all instances of $HTTP_COOKIES_VARS, which has been deprecated, to
  $_COOKIE.

- Replaced all short open tags (<?) with <?php tags, including <?= tags.

- Removed the dependency upon register_globals.

- Database: removed the id column from tblDocumentContent. Changed the
  primary key to be (document, version) with the auto_increment on the
  version field. This enables the database to automatically assign the next
  appropriate version number to any new row inserted into the table without
  having to explicitly look up the existing version value, increment the
  result and store that as part of the insert statement. It guarantees that
  there will be no conflicts or duplication of version numbers by
  simultaneous inserts. The id field was not required as it was not used
  anywhere except as a convenient identifier. It was easily replaced by
  (document id, version).

- Database: Moved the lock field into a separate table for managing locks.
  Fixes a problem where it was possible, although unlikely, for two people to
  simultaneously request a lock on a document.

- The settings file, inc/inc.Settings.php, is renamed in the distribution to
  inc/inc.Settings-sample.php. This is to avoid any existing settings being
  deleted during an upgrade. To use MyDMS for the first time, users must now
  copy (or move) this file to inc/inc.Settings.php and edit before
  using MyDMS.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in version 1.4.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------		     

- All files released as GPL as license recommends.

- You can now prepare both personal and global lists of keywords and
  insert them easily for your documents


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in Version 1.3.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Choose language and theme
  Users can now choose their preferred language and theme on the
  login-screen.

- Split of language file
  inc.Language.php has been splitted so that every language is
  provided in its own file.

- Added ADOdb
  Due to ADOdb MyDMS is no longer limited to MySQL. Every database
  that is supported by ADOdb can be used together with MyDMS

- Admin-Tool: Overview of folders and documents
  A tool that shows a list of all folders and documents together 
  with the ACLs has been added. The section "admin-tools" will
  become bigger in the next versions (import files etc).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in Version 1.3.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- New feature: Auto-Conversion to HTML
  When uploading files they are now converted to HTML automatically.
  So you can now even view Winword-files online with your favourite
  browser.

- Integrated themes
  Themes (again: thanks to Marcel van Groenigen), which were only
  available by a seperate download so far, are now fully integrated
  into MyDMS.
  I'm looking forward to MacOS X Themes :-)

- Fixed bug: Search function
  An error occured if no folder had been chosen. This has been fixed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in Version 1.2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved searching functionality
  MyDMS now offers you a lot more options to help you find exactly
  what you were looking for.
  This is only the first stop of improvement: Look forward to an
  even more powerful search engine in the next versions :-)

- Security-Bug: Session-ID
  One could guess the session-id very easily, since it was only a
  two digit number. This has been corrected so that it should now
  be impossible to get illegal access this way.
  Tip: Empty tblSessions once a day (by a cron-job for example).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Changes in Version 1.2.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Move documents and folders
  If you have put folders or documents to the wrong place or just
  want to re-organize the structure you can now easily move
  documents and folders.

- New languages
  A Russian (thanks to Dmitri) and a Durch version (thanks to André
  Koot) are now available, too.

- Upload-Bug
  With certain configurations moving the temporary file of on upload
  caused problems. MyDMS now uses the built-in move_uploaded_file()
  function to prevent this error.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Changes in Version 1.1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Sequence of Documents and Folders
  One of the most wanted features has been realized: The user has
  now full control of the sequence in which documents and folders
  appear in the system.

- Related Documents
  Every documents now has a list of link to related documents.
  There are two kinds of links: public and private ones; public
  links can be seen by anyone, while private ones are only visible
  to the user that created them.
  Users with read-only access can only add private links, while
  users with at least read-write access can decide which type of
  link they want to add.
  Private links can only be deleted by the user that has created
  them while public links - no matter who created them - can be
  deleted by all users with read-write access.

- Fixed Bug: Delete documents
  When deleting documents they were removed only from the database.
  The files in the content-directory were kept.

- Fixed Bug: View and download documents.
  Very ling filenames (more than 70 characters) caused problems
  with viewing and downloading of documents. By runnning the
  db-update filenames with up to 150 characters are now possible.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Changes in Version 1.1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Spanish translation
  Eugenio Ramajo has completely translated MyDMS to Spanish

- Disable guest-login
  You can now disable the guest-login introduced in Version 1.1.0
  by setting $_enableGuestLogin to false.

- Confirmation for deletion
  When deleting documents or folders you now have to confirm this
  action to prevent you from accidentaly deleting important data.

- Security improved
  By manually changing the folder-ID in the URL it was possible to
  "illegaly" show folders or documents (but downloading or viewing
  the actual content was not possible).


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Changes in Version 1.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- Guest-Login
  You can now choose to log-in as guest so that you can access your
  documents more quickly. The guest user cannot be added to the ACLs.
  So take care that the default access is at least "read" if you wish
  to have access with the guest-user.
  You cannot edit the guest-users's account.

- Download documents more quickly
  If you want to download the current version (or view it online) there
  is no more need to scroll to the end of the document's page: Now there
  is a button just on top of the site for downloading the current version.

- Icons for Mime-Types
  According to the document's MIME-type an additional icon is show.
  (Icons from KDE3).

- Correct filename when downloading
  When downloading a file it was named data.[extension] up to know. This has
  been replaced by the original filename.


-------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Changes in Version 1.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- if you had the GNU test-package installed on your machine, the function
  getText() caused a fatal error. The problem was solved by renaming the
  function.
